                    Now lets talk about my interest in gaming. I like gaming since my childhood I played many
                    games in many devices and consoles like PSP,PS2,PS4,mobile games and PC games.
                    I mostly prefer to play single player games. Soulsborne games are the ones I like most.
                    I played some of the most famous soulsborne published by Fromsoftware. As for mobile
                    games BGMI(AKA PUBG) is my favourite used to play with my homies a lot.
